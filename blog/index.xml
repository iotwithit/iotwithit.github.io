      <description>Part Two TinyML ML mindset The end?   Part Two Part one of this introduction to Machine Learning for embedded software engineers has been the hard one. When I say hard, I mean hard as in hard skills.
I tried to guide you through the learning process with development boards and code, and I ended the article with the promise the following part would be softer.
How can this part be softer?</description>

      <description>Introduction Where to start? First steps into practice What&amp;rsquo;s next?   Introduction Last October, I met Jacob Beningo and he asked me if I was curious about Machine Learning applications for embedded systems. I had some general ideas of Machine Learning: something from my Master&amp;rsquo;s, something from my job in Zerynth and Skypersonic, something from everyone-on-the-internet-talking-about-machine-learning.
But I never had the opportunity to really get into it, so why not?</description>
